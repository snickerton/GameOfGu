# GameOfGu
A very simple random game created during a family gathering on New Years Day by Donghua Gu

Rules:
 1) There are a number of chip stacks, each of uniform color
    (e.g. a stack of yellow chips, a stack of blue chips etc.)
 2) Each stack may have any number of chips (of the same color) within them
    (e.g. the stack of yellow chips has 5, but the stack of blue chips has 16)
 3) Each player takes turns removing any number of chips from the stacks,
    however they may not remove chips of different colors at a time
    (e.g. removing 3 or 5 yellow chips is legal, but removing 1 blue chip and 3 yellow chips is not)
 4) The last player to remove a chip from all the stacks is deemed the loser.
